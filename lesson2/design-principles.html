            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <p class="name">Best Buy</p>

            <p>My first example of good design principles comes from Best Buy. I use their mobile site quite often and have been very impressed with many of the design choices. The one I will illustrate here is that of "Hick's Law"</p>
            <p>Hick's Law, in short, is the relationship between the number of options a user has, and their reaction to those options. If a user has a vast number of options to choose from, they will quickly become overwhelmed and may lose interest all together. To fix this, Hick's Law suggests that simplifying options into smaller categories will solve this problem. In this picture, you can see that Best Buy has used Hick's Law to sort the thousands of products they carry into a few categories. These categories will then further guide you toward your desired product through other, more specific, sortings. This is a way you can utilize Hick's Law multiple times.</p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <p class="name">BYU TV</p>

            <p>The next example of good design principles is contrast. Here we can see a great exapmle of how using contrast can make information stand out. The black background opens up the site to use a variety of colors to emphasize content. Here they've used white text to really emphasize the title and description of the film. Using this black background has also helped the thumbnail of the film stand out.</p>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <p class="name">National Hockey League</p>
            <a href="http://nhl.com">NHL.com</a>
            <img src="images/nhl.com-screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot of nhl.com home page on mobile browser">
            <p>The last design concept I will discuss is repetition. This image is of the home page of the National Hockey League. Many good design practices are used here, but repetition is specifically utilized by keeping the same font throughout the page. Between the scores on the top, to the titles on the videos, this site uses the same font. This is important to keep things consistent so that it is pleasing to the viewer. Too many different fonts on a page can be very distracting.</p>
